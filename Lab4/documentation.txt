The program is composed of three classes:

1. FileOperation is a class which is used for reading the content of a file and returning it as a Scanner.
2. FA (Finite Automata) class is the main class of the program. It has the fields of a Finite Automata (set of states, set of final states,
initial state, the alphabet and the set of transitions) and getters for them.
In the constructor, a method is called together with the scanner returned by the FileOperation class and
assigns to each field the corresponding values from the file.
The additional methods are the ones for verifying if a string is a final state and if FA is a DFA.
These methods are used in the seqIsAccepted method which is the method to verify if, For a DFA, a sequence is accepted by the FA.
The user gives a sequence of digits from the alphabet and this method verifies if it is accepted by starting from the initial state and
parsing the sequence by going to the next state with the transition.
3. Main - the main function is the one that calls the readFile method, initializes the FA, prints the menu, reads the command and
executes it.
